# PlatoonSandbox.Altis
An Arma 3 Sandbox Scenario

A pre-built Platoon is ready at your disposal. 3 squads, each with a leadership element and 2 six-man fireteams.

You can choose a direct command squad from a few different units.

Check your Journal for a list of things to do.

----

situations I need for the sandbox

* If a pilot is shot down I want him to notify me via radio
* If a pilot is shot down I want patrols to go after him (they kinda already do)
* If a pilot is shot down he should know to go and hide somewhere
* if help is on the way, he should be able to pop smoke and show us where he is exactly


For my local units, I'd like to "globally":
  - remove night vision, laser designators and other crap, silencers
  - ADD silencers, night vision

Tell a downed pilot to get into a vehicle so I can transport him home.
